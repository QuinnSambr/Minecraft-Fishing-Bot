# Minecraft-AutoFish-Bot

A script written for the purpose of exprimenting with OpenCV & PyAutoGUI

## Python libraries
```bash
OpenCV2
PyAutoGUI
MSS
ImageGrab
PyDirectInput

```

## How It Works ?
```bash
1. An OpenCV window opens displaying the Minecraft window
2. A bounding box is drawn over the bobber detected
3. When the Y-axis increases this signifies a the bobber dropping
4. A keystroke simulating reeling and casting
5. Repeats from 2-4 until instance is terminated
```
